<h2>Job offer</h2>

<p>You would like to offer a job as a Java developer for several candidates.</p>
<p>Your company has a special rule written in Java for decision-making.</p>
<pre><code>boolean offerAJob =
        (knowJava && yearsOfExperienceInJava >= 1) ||
        (knowPython && yearsOfExperienceInPython >= 3);</code>
</pre>

<p>A small explanation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>knowJava</strong> is a boolean variable that shows whether the candidate knows Java or not.</li>
    <li><strong>knowPython</strong> is a boolean variable that shows whether the candidate knows Python or not.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>yearsOfExperienceInJava</strong> is an <code>int</code> variable that shows how many years of Java
        programming the candidate has.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>yearsOfExperienceInPython</strong> is another <code>int</code> variable that shows how many years of
        Python programming the candidate has.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The list of candidates with their skills is the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>John:</strong> knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 1; knowPython = false;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 0;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mary:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 3;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Olivia:</strong> knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Alexander: </strong>knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 3; knowPython = true;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Andrew:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 1; knowPython = false;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 1;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Emily:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true;
        yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>Using a decision-making rule, select all candidates that will be good for your company.</strong>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
    Note, sometimes a candidate may have the experience, but still knows the programming language badly. In this case,
    we consider their knowledge as false.
