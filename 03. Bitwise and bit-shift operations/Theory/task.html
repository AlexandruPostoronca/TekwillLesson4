<h2>Bitwise and bit-shift operations</h2>
<h4>Bitwise operators</h4>
<p>There are four bitwise operators, each of which goes through all bits of an operand (the number on which the
    operation is done) one by one (bitwise) and produces a new number as a result.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>~</code> <strong>(bitwise NOT, inversion, complement) </strong>is a unary operator that
        <strong>inverses</strong>the bits of the number in binary format, transforming every <code>0</code> into
        <code>1</code> and every<code>1</code> into <code>0</code>. It also changes the sign bit of the value.
    </li>
    <li><code>|</code> <strong>(bitwise OR) </strong>is a binary operator that returns <code>1</code> if at least one
        operand digit is <code>1</code>, otherwise, it returns <code>0</code>.
    </li>
    <li><code>&amp;</code> <strong>(bitwise AND)</strong> is a binary operator that returns <code>1</code> if both
        operand digits are <code>1</code>, otherwise, the result is <code>0</code>.
    </li>
    <li><code>^</code> <strong>(bitwise XOR) </strong>is a binary operator that returns <code>1</code> if exactly one
        operand is <code>1</code>, otherwise, it returns <code>0</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-primary">The listed operators can be applied to integer and boolean operands. If both
    operands are integer, bitwise operations will be performed. If both operands are booleans, they will undergo
    corresponding logical operations (except <code>~</code>).
</div>

<p>To see how these operators work, let's assume we have two integer numbers: <code>15</code> and <code>10</code>. The
    first number's binary representation is <code>1111</code>, the second one is <code>1010</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int first = 15;  // binary format 1111
int second = 10; // binary format 1010

int bitwiseAnd = first & second; // 1111 & 1010 = 1010, the result is 10
int bitwiseOr = first | second;  // 1111 | 1010 = 1111, the result is 15
int bitwiseXor = first ^ second; // 1111 ^ 1010 = 0101, the result is 5
int bitwiseNot = ~first; // ~ 00000000000000000000000000001111 = 11111111111111111111111111110000, the result is -16
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you've got the principle, we will demonstrate how to apply them in practice in next topics, as well as in
    our projects.</p>

<h4>Bit-shift operators</h4>
<p>In addition to bitwise operators, Java also provides <strong>bit-shift</strong> operators that can be used to move
    bits of an integer number from one position to another.</p>
<p>There are three bit-shift operators:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is a signed bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the left by the distance
        specified in the right operand. It fills the empty position with zeros.
    </li>
    <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is a signed bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the right by the distance
        specified in the right operand. It fills the empty position with the values of the sign bit.
    </li>
    <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is an unsigned bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the right by the
        distance specified in the right operand. It is almost the same as <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, but the shifted values
        are filled up with zeros. The result of the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operator is always positive.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The following example illustrates how to perform<strong> fast multiplication and division</strong> by two using
    bit-shift operators.</p>

<pre><code>int val = 25;   // binary: 0001 1001, decimal: 25

val = val << 1; // binary: 0011 0010, decimal: 50
val = val << 2; // binary: 1100 1000, decimal: 200

int anotherVal = 14;   // binary: 1110, decimal: 14
anotherVal = anotherVal >> 1; // binary: 0111, decimal: 7</code>
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the result of the left-shift operator is equivalent to the product of multiplication by two, and the
    result of the right-shift operator is equivalent to that of a division by two. To summarize, when we use signed
    bit-shift operators we perform the multiplication or division of the left operand by two depending on the right
    operand.</p>

<pre><code>int newVal = 25;

newVal = newVal << 1; // 25 * 2^1 = 50
newVal = newVal << 3; // 50 * 2^3 = 400
newVal = newVal >> 2; // 400 / 2^2 = 100</code>
</pre>

<p>Another example is the <strong>calculation of the midpoint</strong> of an integer positive interval.</p>
<pre><code>int left = 10;
int right = 20;

int mid = left + right >> 1; // this is 15!</code>
</pre>

<p>Of course, this magic produces the same result as <code>(left + right) / 2</code>, but the bit-shift version is often
    considered a faster way to obtain it. Some algorithms in the Java standard library use this approach.</p>
<p>Unlike the signed right shift (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>), the unsigned <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> does not consider sign
    bits: instead, it just shifts all the bits to the right and pads the result with zeros from the left. It means that
    for negative numbers the result is always positive. For positive numbers, signed and unsigned right shifts have the
    same result.</p>

<pre><code>int value = -200; // binary: 11111111111111111111111100111000
int signedShift = value >> 2; // binary: 11111111111111111111111111001110, decimal: -50
int unsignedShift = value >>> 2; // binary: 00111111111111111111111111001110, decimal: 1073741774</code>
</pre>

<h4>Precedence of bitwise and bit-shift operations</h4>
<p>Similar to arithmetic operators, bitwise and bit-shift operators have so-called <strong>precedence </strong>that
    determines the order of performing and grouping operations in the expression. Operations with higher precedence are
    performed before those with lower precedence. In the table below you will find all the operators we've discussed so
    far ordered by their precedence in descending order. </p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">When the operators have equal precedence, another rule is applied. It is called
    associativity, and it determines whether the evaluation should be performed from left to right or vice versa.
</div>
<p>All the operators we have considered are evaluated from left to right, the way you are used to.</p>
<p>This means that for the two expressions <code>first | second &amp; third</code> and<code>(first | second) &amp;
    third</code> the operations will be executed in a different order and hence results may vary. If you go back to the
    <code>left + right &gt;&gt; 1</code> example in the previous section, you can see that there we don't have to use
    brackets like in the <code>(left + right) / 2</code> expression because addition has higher precedence than all
    bit-shift operations. Remember these priorities when you combine arithmetic operators with bit operations. </p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In this topic, we've learned how to perform some operations on the bits of integer numbers and how
    they correspond to some arithmetic operations. Bitwise operators process bits one by one according to the logical
    operations, while bit-shift ones allow us to move the whole bit pattern left or right. The theory may seem a bit
    complicated, however, it is essential to understand the basics to apply them in practice, as we will learn further
    on. Now, some practice will certainly help you become more comfortable with the new information!</p>
