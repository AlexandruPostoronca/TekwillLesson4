<h2>Hiring a chef</h2>
<p>
    Imagine that you are an HR manager at a restaurant, and you need to hire a chef. To do that, you need to collect
    some preliminary data about the candidates.
</p>
<p>
    You have a special form for the candidates that includes 3 fields: first name, years of experience and cuisine
    preference.
</p>
<p>
    Your program should read all the words (or numbers) from the three lines and output "The form for <code>first
    name</code> is completed. We will contact you if we need a chef who cooks <code>cuisine preference</code> dishes and
    has <code>years of experience</code> years of experience."</p>
